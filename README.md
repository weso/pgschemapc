# PG-Schema_PC

This repository contains a prototype implementation for the PG-Schema with Property Constraints extension.

## Building and installation 

The code has been implemented in Rust and it can be run using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

Once cargo has been installed, you can run the tests as:

```sh
cargo test
```

The tests contain the examples in the paper as well as other test-cases.
