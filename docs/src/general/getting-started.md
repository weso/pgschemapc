# Getting started

In order to verify that the installation has been successful, you can run the following command to check that everything is working as expected. 

```sh
pgschemapc --version
```

Once you have `pgschemapc` [installed](./installation.md) and verified, the next step is to start using the different subcommands that are bundled within the tool.
`pgschemapc --help` shows the different commands.
